title: "SDG 2.2 and the 2023 Nutrition Month Data"
format: docx
---

There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals, 169 targets, and 232 indicators. SDG 2 deals with nutrition.

**SDG 2:** End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.  

**Target 2.2:** By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons.  


**Indicator 2.2.1:** Prevalence of stunting (height for age <-2 standard deviation from the median of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age.    
The targets set for 2025 and 2030 for stunting among children under five are to achieve a reduction of 40% and 50% respectively from the levels of 2012.

**Indicator 2.2.2:** Prevalence of malnutrition (weight for height >+2 or <-2 standard deviation from the median of the WHO Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age, by type (wasting and overweight).   
The targets set for 2025 and 2030 for wasting among children under five are to reduce and maintain the prevalence of wasting to 5% and 3% respectively.  

The most recent, [UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Joint Malnutrition Estimates Expanded Databases May 2023](https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/malnutrition/), has Sri Lankan data on stunting and wasting for the year 2016.

#| out-width: 75%
#| label: fig-STNT
#| fig-cap: "Proportion of Children Stunted(%)"
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/SH_STA_STNT.png')
```

This database also has modeled data up to 2022 on stunting (@fig-stnt) but not on wasting.  

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| out-width: 75%
#| label: fig-WAST
#| fig-cap: "Proportion of Children Wasted(%)"
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/SH_STA_WAST.png')
```
 The data on wasting is only up to 2016 (@fig-WAST)

\



The last three DHSs conducted in 2000, 2006/7 and 2016 have shown minimal reduction in the prevalence of stunting and wasting among children under 5.  

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| label: fig-dhs
#| fig-cap: "Proportion (%) of Children Stunted & Wasted in DHS 2000, 2006/7 & 2016"
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/dhs_trend2.png')
```


In fact, the prevalence of stunting was found to be 17.5% in both 2006/7 and 2016 (@fig-dhs). A 40% reduction (the target for 2025) in stunting from the levels of 2012 translates to 10.5% and a 50% reduction (the target for 2030) translates to 8.8%. The nutrition month data for the last three years - 2021, 2022, and 2023 - reveal a worrying trend.  

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| label: fig-nmnt
#| fig-cap: "Proportion (%) of Children Stunted & Wasted in 2021, 2022 & 2023 - Nutrition Month Data"
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/nm_trend2.png')
```

The prevalence of stunting had gone up from 7.4% in 2021 to 10.3% in 2023, still lower than 10.5% the target for 2025, but if the recent upward trend continues it is likely that we will end up with a prevalence of stunting well above the target (@fig-nmnt).  
The prevalence of wasting among children under five is 10% in 2023 which is well above the 2025 target of 5%.  
The DHS data is based on a nationally representative sample and the nutrition month data is based on an attempt to measure all eligible children with an estimated participation rate of 96.5%. Therefore, the differences in the rates are unlikely to be due to the differences in the methodology.  
The nutrition month data includes prevalence by age groups - under 1 year, 1 to 2 years and 3 to 5 years.   

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| label: fig-wastenm
#| fig-cap: "Proportion (%) of Children Wasted by age group in 2021, 2022 & 2023 - Nutrition Month Data"
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/waste_age_nm.png')
```

The prevalence of wasting has increased in all three age groups and there is a clear increase in wasting with increasing age (@fig-wastenm)  

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| label: fig-stuntnm
#| fig-cap: "Proportion (%) of Children Stunted by age group in 2021, 2022 & 2023 - Nutrition Month Data"
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/stunt_age_nm.png')
```

The prevalence of stunting has increased in all three age groups (@fig-stuntnm)








It is a good idea to look at the overall trends over the past couple of decades but we don't have nutrition month data going back so many years. We do have DHS data for 2000, 2006/7 and 2016 on the prevalence of stunting and wasting among children under 5 years. The DHS data and the nutrition month data are strictly not comparable. The DHS data is based on a nationally representative sample and the nutrition month data is from measurements made on all eligible children.  
There had been a slight drop in stunting and wasting between 2000 and 2006/7 but the rates remained static between 2006/7 and 2016.


There is a big difference in the prevalence of stunting and wasting between 2016 DHS and 2021 Nutrition month.
